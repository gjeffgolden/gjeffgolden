# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jeff.

### I'm a full-stack developer who opted out of a successful career in digital marketing to turn a lifelong passion for computer science into a profession. My core tech stack is Rails and React.js, and I've also built projects using Node.js, most major CSS frameworks, Vue.js, TypeScript, Django and vanilla JavaScript.
